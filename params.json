This is accomplished by: \r\n- emitting mouse events over a socket connection,\r\n- feeding them into an eventsource, and \r\n- have \"drawing layers\" listen and react to that source.\r\n\r\n**Static.** Try it out yourself (static Version): <a href=\"http://mirkoklukas.github.io/drawing-and-animation-tool-js/demo/\">Flat Circle</a>.\r\n\r\nNote that the demo has not been cross browser tested - it's a sketch! Works fine in **Chrome** (v34.0), **Firefox** (v28.0), and  **Safari** (v6.0).\r\n\r\nThe tool has been inspired by Andreas Gysin's <a href=\"http://www.ertdfgcvb.com/p1/chronodraw/\">Chronodraw</a>.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
